**Abstract:**

The ability of cells to sense and adapt to curvy topographical features has been implicated in organ morphogenesis, tissue repair, and
tumor metastasis. However, how individual cells or multicellular assemblies sense and differentiate curvatures remains elusive. Here,
we reveal a curvature sensing mechanism in which surface tension can selectively activate either actin or integrin flows, leading to
bifurcating cell migration modes: focal adhesion formation that enables cell crawling at convex front edges and actin cable assembly
that pulls cells forward at concave front edges. The molecular flows and curved front morphogenesis are sustained by coordinated
cellular tension generation and transmission. We track the molecular flows and mechanical force transduction pathways by a phase-
field model, which predicts that multicellular curvature sensing is more efficient than individual cells, suggesting collective
intelligence of cells. The unique ability of cells in curvature sensing and migration mode bifurcating may offer insights into emergent
collective patterns and functions of living active systems at different length scales.
