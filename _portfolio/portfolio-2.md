**Abstract:**

Cellular force transmission across a hierarchy of molecular switchers is central to mechanobiological responses. However, current cellular force microscopies suffer from low throughput and resolution. Here we introduce and train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to paint out traction force maps of cell monolayers with high fidelity to the experimental traction force microscopy (TFM). The GAN analyzes traction force maps as an image-to-image translation problem, where its generative and discriminative neural networks are simultaneously cross-trained by hybrid experimental and numerical datasets. In addition to capturing the colony-size and substrate-stiffness dependent traction force maps, the trained GAN predicts asymmetric traction force patterns for multicellular monolayers seeding on substrates with stiffness gradient, implicating collective durotaxis. Further, the neural network can extract experimentally inaccessible, the hidden relationship between substrate stiffness and cell contractility, which underlies cellular mechanotransduction. Trained solely on datasets for epithelial cells, the GAN can be extrapolated to other contractile cell types using only a single scaling factor. The digital TFM serves as a high-throughput tool for mapping out cellular forces of cell monolayers and paves the way toward data-driven discoveries in cell mechanobiology.
