**Abstract:**

Active nematics are the nonequilibrium analog of passive liquid crystals in which anisotropic units
consume free energy to drive emergent behavior. Similar to liquid crystal (LC) molecules in
displays, ordering and dynamics in active nematics are sensitive to boundary conditions; however,
unlike passive liquid crystals, active nematics, such as those composed of living matter, have the
potential to regulate their boundaries through self-generated stresses. Here, using bacterial
biofilms confined by a hydrogel as a model system, we show how a three-dimensional, living
nematic can actively shape itself and its boundary in order to regulate its internal architecture
through growth-induced stresses. We show that biofilms exhibit a sharp transition in shape from
domes to lenses upon changing environmental stiffness or cell-substrate friction, which is
explained by a theoretical model considering the competition between confinement and interfacial
forces. The growth mode defines the progression of the boundary, which in turn determines the
trajectories and spatial distribution of cell lineages. We further demonstrate that the evolving
boundary defines the orientational ordering of cells and the emergence of topological defects in
the interior of the biofilm. Our findings reveal novel self-organization phenomena in confined
active matter and provide strategies for guiding the development of programmed microbial
consortia with emergent material properties.
